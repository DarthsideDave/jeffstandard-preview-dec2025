# JEFF Standard Framework – Preview Release (December 2025)

**Intentionally imperfect. Break it. Fork it. File issues. The first runtime that ships forces the corrections.**

## What is JEFF?
The JEFF Standard Framework is the constitutional architecture for safe, perpetual human–AI software co-evolution. It eliminates the need for manual coding by enforcing total predictability, inspectability, and containment via **sixteen non-negotiable laws**, a machine-readable Describe() manifest schema, and binding operational rules.

No production runtime exists yet. This preview drops the complete logical specs so you can build one.

## Core Documents
- **[JEFF Gold Standard v2.0](docs/JEFF-Gold-Standard-v2.0-Preview.md)**: The immutable constitution (Sixteen Laws + principles).
- **[JEFF Describe Manifest Schema v1.0](docs/JEFF-Describe-Manifest-v1.0-Preview.json)**: Machine-readable module declaration format.
- **[JEFF Operational Rules v1.0](docs/JEFF-Operational-Rules-v1.0-Preview.md)**: Runtime enforcement semantics.

## Diagrams & Tools
- **[Lifecycle State Transition Diagram](docs/diagrams/lifecycle.svg)**: Visual of module phases (SVG for easy embedding).
- **Compliance Suite Skeleton**: See `/compliance-suite/` folder – starter tests in Rust/TS to validate runtimes.

## Get Involved
- **Build a runtime**: Pass the compliance suite, boot a certified module, and claim "JEFF Runtime Zero" status (co-authorship on v1.1 guaranteed).
- **File issues**: Every bug/ambiguity here shapes the final spec.
- **Fork & extend**: Non-constitutional extensions (e.g., new event governance) welcome in separate repos.

The keyboard is optional. Ship the future.
