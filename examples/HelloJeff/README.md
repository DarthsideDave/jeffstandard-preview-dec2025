# HelloJeff – JEFF Genesis Module

When loaded into any conforming JEFF runtime:
1. On Init → Bind → Activate: prints exactly one line to console
2. All subsequent Tick calls are no-op
3. Module stays alive forever in pure, idle state

This is the canonical "Hello World" of the JEFF Standard.

The first runtime that successfully loads and executes this module and produces the correct output wins permanent glory as **Runtime Zero**.

Ship it.
