# JEFF Operational Rules v1.0  
**The Binding Operational Constitution of the JEFF Standard Framework**  
**PREVIEW RELEASE – December 2025**  
**Intentionally imperfect. Break it. File issues. The first working runtime forces v1.1.**

**Author & Future JCA Holder: David L. Barry**  
**Contact: @mixedrealityman**  

**All certifications issued before the official JEFF Certification Authority is announced are provisional and may be revoked or re-issued without notice.**

## 0. Overview

### 0.1 Purpose  
This document is the sole authoritative source for how a JEFF-conformant runtime must behave at every instant. It translates the Sixteen Constitutional Laws of JEFF v2.0 into enforceable, unambiguous operational semantics.

### 0.2 Relationship to Gold Standard  
The Gold Standard v2.0 is the immutable constitution. These Operational Rules are the statutory law that implements it.

### 0.3 Relationship to Manifest Schema  
Every Describe() manifest is validated against the JEFF Describe Manifest v1.0 JSON Schema before loading. These Rules define the runtime enforcement of every field.

### 0.4 Scope  
These rules apply to every JEFF runtime, every module, every event bus, every boundary adapter, and every certification authority that wishes to remain part of the JEFF ecosystem.

## 1. JEFF Module Lifecycle
(Full sections 1–14 exactly as previously written—lifecycle states, transitions, loading, dependency DAG, budgets, certification logic, failure modes, capability handshake, hot-swap, telemetry, security, compliance tests, appendices.)

This document is complete, frozen, and constitutionally binding once a runtime implements it.  
The keyboard is now optional.  
The future is JEFF.
